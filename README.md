# Data-Visualization
This file is a RStudio based code. This code is based on the data that I got after visulaizing the my text data from the Gephi 
interface after running several algorithms that described the properties of network like degree of the nodes, betweenness centrality, modularity class(community),
clustering coefficient, etc. 

Visualization is a pivotal concentration in the field of analytics as it unravels the mysterious insights from the huge amount of
data sets that we deal with.

The current example is based on the battles from Game of Thrones. Visualization tells us the most important battles, ehich character from the story is important 
in which battle.

The main library used for this project was ggplot, vcd and alluvial was used for unstructured data.
